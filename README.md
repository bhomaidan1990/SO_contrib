## Introduction

This repository contains **Answers** and **Questions** of my best contribution on my [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8618242/bilal).

I highly believe in the usefulness and the gain we get from such public open communities to improve our world and sharpen our skills, since I have much help from that community, I decided to help others in return.
